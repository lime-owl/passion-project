Passion Project

Clearly articulate and document the application idea for your passion project. This should be summarized with a few sentences and could be communicated over the course of an elevator ride (ie. an Elevator Pitch).

Develop a list of functional and non-functional requirements. Remember these are broad concepts that will be more clearly understood through the related features.

Create a prioritized feature list. Break your features into “Must Have” and “Nice to Have”.
	Using a tool (ie. Draw.io or Visio), create an entity relationship diagram.
  
Create a high-fidelity prototype that accurately summarizes the different user flows for your must-have features.

Create a repository in Github to track the progress of your project. Use the Automated Kanban project template. 

Create and prioritize issues for your must-have features. Recall that you can also add sub-tasks to an issue to help clearly track what is required to build a feature.

Create issues for any other general tasks that are not directly related to a feature (ie. investigating hosting services).

Add the deliverables above to a README.md file (use Github-flavoured markdown to format the document in a professional manner).

Add philweier to your repository as a contributor.
